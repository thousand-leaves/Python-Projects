# A program that takes a number and prints times table of that number.
# Hint: donâ€™t manually set your code to print each number, one by one. Use a loop.


# for loop example

number = 1

for count in range(1, 13):
    print(number, "x", count, "=", number * count)

# while loop example

#count = 1
#number = int(input("Please enter a number: "))

#while count < 13:
#    print(count, "x", number, "=", count * number)
#    count += 1
